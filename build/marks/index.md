# Test!
# Hi there!
Welcome to the test markdown file.
This is a sample paragraph to demonstrate the Downtown framework.
You can create headings, lists, links, and more using Markdown syntax.

## Features
- Easy to use
- Fast conversion
- Customizable templates

## Getting Started
To get started, simply create a Markdown file, add it to your Sitefile and if its not an Index file, create a .Site file for that file and run the Downtown build command.
```
bash cmd/build.sh
```
or for Windows:
```
cmd\build.bat
```

Feel free to explore and modify this file to see how Downtown processes Markdown files into HTML!
